# social-feed-frontend
This project is a dynamic web application developed using HTML5, CSS3, and Vanilla JavaScript. The application focuses on implementing core front-end concepts such as DOM manipulation, event handling, and client-side data management. All UI elements, including posts, comments, and interactive components, are created and updated dynamically using JavaScript based on user interactions. Application state is maintained using JavaScript objects and arrays, and data persistence is achieved through the browser’s localStorage API. No external JavaScript frameworks, UI libraries, or backend servers are used in this project, ensuring a clear demonstration of beginner-level JavaScript fundamentals and compliance with academic requirements.
